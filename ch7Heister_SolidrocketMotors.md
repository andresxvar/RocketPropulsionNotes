# Chapter 7 -- Solid Rocket Motors

## Introduction

Solid rocket motors (SRMs) are simple and boast a quick response, that is there are no moving parts and don't require pumping systems. They also have higher volumetric impulse than LRE/HRE since the propellant can be tightly packed.

However, SRMs have clear disadvantages, the fuels reach lower Isp, SMRs are difficult to throttle, they have high mass fractions, and since the propellants are premixed in the grain there are strict handling and manufacturing protocols. Also, they are difficult to test prior to using them.

The principal use in missiles, orbit transfer vehicles and boosters.

## SRM internal ballistics

The burning rate can be measured via St. Robert's Law: $r_b=a p_c^n$. Typically plotted in the log form with regards $log(r_b) \sim log(p_c)$.

Although initial burning can actually exceed St. Robert's law via erosive burning. Actually there is no actual physical erosion, instead the smaller radius port at the beginning of burning leads to faster flow, which means thermal and momentum boundary layers are thinner thus enhancing heat transfer.
