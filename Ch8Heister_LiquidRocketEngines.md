# 8.1 Basics

Liquid rocket engines (LRE) enjoy a higher Isp than solid alternatives. These rockets also allow for throttling by controlling fuel mass flow rates. However, they tend to be more complex designs and have lower mass fractions.

These rockets may be *monopropellant* (Isp~200-230 sec) which have simple design and are primarily used in thrusters in spacecraft. On the other hand larger rockets are typically *bipropellant*. Hydrocarbon bipropellant rockets such as LOX/CH_4 (Isp~250-350 sec). LOX/H2 bipropellant can reach higher Isp~425-500s however there are additional complexities with handling H2 because of its low density they require large storage tanks resulting in weight costs.

Bipropellants may be pressure-fed, requiring large tanks with a pressurized gas like He or N2, or pump-fed, requiring turbopump installation.

The thrust chamber which includes the combustion chamber and the nozzle is typically regeneratively cooled. Alternative ablative liners enable the high temperatures out of the combustion chamber that the nozzle must withstand.

Chamber pressure is an important parameter than can determine sizing requirements. For example using the formula $A_t=\dot{m}c^*/gp_c$, a higher chamber pressure, $p_c$ results in smaller TC size, which is beneficial for reducing weight. However, higher $p_c$ may also require larger feed systems.

In the combustion chamber, the injectors are to this day empirically fashioned due to the complexity of multiphase, combustion and thermal analysis required.

The mixture ratio $r=\dot{m}_{ox}/$ can also influence performance. An increase on $r$ leads to an increase in chamber and exit temperatures. Additionally, it increases specific impulse and $c*$ however there is limit value since molecular weight also keeps increasing.
